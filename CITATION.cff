abstract: >-
  VDD is a control-theory approach for adaptive memory retention in RAG systems.
  The decay rate is dynamically modulated by environmental volatility instead of
  being fixed, achieving "never worst" performance across drift patterns without
  manual tuning. Validated on 120 real-world facts across 3 domains (React,
  Python, Node.js) in 42 experiments.
